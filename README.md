## Description 

### Purpose
This is my personal portfolio website. I based the website design on a poster for a French-Canadian film Les Amours Imaginaires. My main goal when creating the website was to make a responsive, single page and easy to read and understand website that was stylistic and visually interesting without having to much clutter or being excessive. 

### Functionality 
#### Features: 
- This website is designed to involve anchors and 2 navigation bars: a top navigation bar for page content via scrolling anchors and a bottom navbar for external links to Twitter, LinkedIn and Github. 

#### Sitemap: 
- As this is a one page website there is no "proper" sitemap. It does however have 4 different sections that the site will scroll (with anchors). These are Home, About, Stack and Projects, which form the content of the page. 

#### Website Screenshots:
INSERT FULLPAGE SCREENSHOT
INSERT TABLET SCREENSHOT
INSERT PHONE SCREENSHOT

#### Tech Stack & Target Audience: 
- It was created using HTML, SASS and CSS as a one-page portfolio of my work as a developer. As this is a portfolio website, the target audience of this website includes potential employers, friends and family.

## Design 

### Design Process
- The design process for this website started with simple instructions for what content to include: 
    - My name and contact details.
    - Links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts.
    - Information about my to demonstrate my personality.
    - My study and work history.
From this information, I began to brainstorm potential ideas via a moodboard and research.
INSERT MOODBOARD SCREENSHOT
Some initial prototype websites were made to look at concepts that seemed interesting. 
INSERT WEBSITE1 AND WEBSITE2 SCREENSHOTS
I decided I would like to go with either a dark blue or dark red colorscheme initially, however I saw this poster whilst looking for ideas and thought it would be an interesting way to express information about myself. 
INSERT POSTER HERE
When I started to think about what the setup for the website would be with the poster in mind, I though i would lay all the information vertically. This ended up being the layout for the phone and tablet versions of the website, however for a larger screen it left a lot of unused space on the page, so the decision to put a static photo on the left with scrollable text on the right was made. 

### Wireframes
Only 2 Wireframes were done for this website as it was designed to be very simple from the start. 
INSERT WIREFRAMES

### Usability Considerations 
In addition to responsiveness for all screen sizes, this website was designed to deliberately have a high contrast between the text and background allows for easy readability. Semantic divs are also used to make sure that the content is accessible for screen-reader users.
