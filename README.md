## Description 

### Purpose
This is my personal portfolio website. I based the website design on a poster for a French-Canadian film Les Amours Imaginaires. My main goal when creating the website was to make a responsive, single page and easy to read and understand website that was stylistic and visually interesting without having to much clutter or being excessive. 

### Functionality 
#### Features: 
- This website is designed to involve anchors and 2 navigation bars: a top navigation bar for page content via scrolling anchors and a bottom navbar for external links to Twitter, LinkedIn and Github. 

#### Sitemap: 
- As this is a one page website there is no "proper" sitemap. It does however have 4 different sections that the site will scroll (with anchors). These are Home, About, Stack and Projects, which form the content of the page. 

#### Website Screenshots:
INSERT FULLPAGE SCREENSHOT
INSERT TABLET SCREENSHOT
INSERT PHONE SCREENSHOT

#### Tech Stack & Target Audience: 
- It was created using HTML, SASS and CSS as a one-page portfolio of my work as a developer. As this is a portfolio website, the target audience of this website includes potential employers, friends and family.

## Design 

### Design Process
- The design process for this website started with simple instructions for what content to include: 
    - My name and contact details.
    - Links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts.
    - Information about my to demonstrate my personality.
    - My study and work history.
From this information, I began to brainstorm potential ideas via a mood board and research.
INSERT MOODBOARD SCREENSHOT
Some initial prototype websites were made to look at concepts that seemed interesting. 
INSERT WEBSITE1 AND WEBSITE2 SCREENSHOTS
I decided I would like to go with either a dark blue or dark red colorscheme initially, however I saw this poster whilst looking for ideas and thought it would be an interesting way to express information about myself. 
INSERT POSTER HERE
This poster then helped to decide the font-style, colorscheme and overall layout of the website.
When I started to think about what the setup for the website would be with the poster in mind, I though I would lay all the information vertically. This ended up being the layout for the phone and tablet versions of the website, however for a larger screen it left a lot of unused space on the page, so the decision to put a static photo on the left with scrollable text on the right was made. 

### Wireframes
Only 2 Wireframes were done for this website as it was designed to be very simple from the start. 
INSERT WIREFRAMES

### Usability Considerations 
In addition to responsiveness for all screen sizes, this website was designed to deliberately have a high contrast between the text and background allows for easy readability. Semantic divs are also used to make sure that the content is accessible for screen-reader users.

## Planning Process

### Project Planning & Timeline
- The general idea behind the planning for this website was to build progressively as I learnt more about HTML, however the project was effectively restarted to account for responsiveness. As such, there were many iterations of the website that were scrapped before work on the final website was started. 

Project Timeline:
- 13/3 Wednesday: Create mood board and Trello. Research possible website designs
- 14/3 Thursday: Begin work on Wireframe. Create basic website structure
- 15/3 Friday:  Scrap all work on website and begin again. 
- 16/3 Monday: Create wireframe for desktop site. 
- 17/3 Tuesday: Focus on adding features to website without structure. 
- 18/3 Wednesday: Learn responsiveness. Scrap previous work and begin again for the 3rd time.
- 19/3 Thursday: Cannibalize previous website functions & create a website with some functions. 
- 20/3 Friday: Create github for website.  Fix responsiveness problems and bug-fixing for website. 
- 21/3 Saturday: Work on documentation and fixing logos on website
